# Sales Data Mart From Adventure Work 2022 OLTP

# Project Description
In this project, I transformed the AdventureWorks2022 dataset from its original OLTP format into a structured data mart designed for analytical purposes. By reorganizing and optimizing the data, I created a solution that enables efficient analysis and visualization of business performance metrics.The project highlights my ability to bridge the gap between raw transactional data and meaningful business intelligence.
